\par
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\par
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\par
 \par
\par
Preamble\par
\par
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and\par
change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your\par
freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all\par
its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software\par
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it.\par
(Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General\par
Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too. \par
\par
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General\par
Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute\par
copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive\par
source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use\par
pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things. \par
\par
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you\par
these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to\par
certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you\par
modify it. \par
\par
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a\par
fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure\par
that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these\par
terms so they know their rights. \par
\par
We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you\par
this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the\par
software. \par
\par
Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone\par
understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is\par
modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what\par
they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not\par
reflect on the original authors' reputations. \par
\par
Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to\par
avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain\par
patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have\par
made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not\par
licensed at all. \par
\par
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. \par
\par
 TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\par
\par
0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed\par
by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General\par
Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a\par
"work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under\par
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\par
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.\par
(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term\par
"modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you". \par
\par
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this\par
License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not\par
restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents\par
constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running\par
the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does. \par
\par
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\par
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish\par
on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\par
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and\par
give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the\par
Program. \par
\par
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at\par
your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. \par
\par
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus\par
forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or\par
work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these\par
conditions: \par
\par
 a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you\par
 changed the files and the date of any change. \par
 b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in\par
 part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed\par
 as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. \par
 c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you\par
 must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most\par
 ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate\par
 copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that\par
 you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these\par
 conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception:\par
 if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an\par
 announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an\par
 announcement.) \par
\par
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections\par
of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered\par
independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do\par
not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you\par
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the\par
Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose\par
permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and\par
every part regardless of who wrote it. \par
\par
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to\par
work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control\par
the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program. \par
\par
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the\par
Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or\par
distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License. \par
\par
3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2)\par
in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided\par
that you also do one of the following: \par
\par
 a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code,\par
 which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\par
 customarily used for software interchange; or, \par
 b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give\par
 any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing\par
 source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding\par
 source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\par
 medium customarily used for software interchange; or, \par
 c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute\par
 corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial\par
 distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable\par
 form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.) \par
\par
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making\par
modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the\par
source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition\par
files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the\par
executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not\par
include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with\par
the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which\par
the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable. \par
\par
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from\par
a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the\par
same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are\par
not compelled to copy the source along with the object code. \par
\par
4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as\par
expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,\par
sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your\par
rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights,\par
from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\par
parties remain in full compliance. \par
\par
5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.\par
However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or\par
its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this\par
License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on\par
the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its\par
terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works\par
based on it. \par
\par
6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the\par
recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy,\par
distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not\par
impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted\par
herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this\par
License. \par
\par
7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or\par
for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you\par
(whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of\par
this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you\par
cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\par
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not\par
distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit\par
royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly\par
or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this\par
License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program. \par
\par
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular\par
circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a\par
whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. \par
\par
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other\par
property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has\par
the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution\par
system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made\par
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system\par
in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor\par
to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system\par
and a licensee cannot impose that choice. \par
\par
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a\par
consequence of the rest of this License. \par
\par
8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries\par
either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who\par
places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution\par
limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or\par
among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the\par
limitation as if written in the body of this License. \par
\par
9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the\par
General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in\par
spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or\par
concerns. \par
\par
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a\par
version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have\par
the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any\par
later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not\par
specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published\par
by the Free Software Foundation. \par
\par
10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose\par
distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission.\par
For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\par
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be\par
guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free\par
software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. \par
\par
NO WARRANTY\par
\par
11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE\par
PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN\par
WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS"\par
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT\par
LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\par
PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH\par
YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY\par
SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. \par
\par
12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY\par
COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM\par
AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,\par
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\par
PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE\par
OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE\par
WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\par
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. \par
